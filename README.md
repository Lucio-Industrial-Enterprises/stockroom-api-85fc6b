# Warehouse tools

Small Python utilities for warehouse order and shipping workflows.

Run the tests with `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.

## Shipping

`shipping_quote(weight_kg, zone, service="standard")` returns a delivery quote
in dollars. Zones are `local` and `regional`; weights must be positive.
Standard shipping costs $5 locally or $8 regionally, plus $1.50 per kilogram,
rounded to two decimal places. Express adds $7 to the standard quote for either
zone. Omitting `service` preserves the standard quote. Unknown services raise
`ValueError`.

```python
from warehouse.rates import shipping_quote

shipping_quote(2, "local")                     # 8.0
shipping_quote(2, "local", service="express")  # 15.0
```

The command-line entry point prints a quote for an order. `--service` accepts
`standard` (the default) or `express`; other values are rejected.

```sh
python3 -m warehouse.cli 2 local                    # $8.00
python3 -m warehouse.cli 2 regional --service express # $18.00
```
